        My favorite part about playing chess and board games like Catan is the strategy and game theory involved. I have a passion for optimization and enjoy watching rocket launchesâ€”I've been following space launches for over 10 years, often waking up early to catch the latest events. My travels have taken me to Boston, San Diego, Rome, Venice, Florence, Madrid, Barcelona, and Baku, Azerbaijan, where I was born.
