        I have been a student at the Olga Radko Endowed Math Circle at UCLA for 11 years and a volunteer instructor for the past 2 years. Topics we've explored include Fourier series and projective geometries. My favorite part of teaching is seeing the creative solutions students develop for challenging math problemsâ€”it's incredibly rewarding to give back to the community that raised me.
